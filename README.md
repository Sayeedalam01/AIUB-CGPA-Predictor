### How it Works:

The **AIUB CGPA Predictor** uses the following formula to calculate your final cumulative CGPA:

$$ \text{Final CGPA} = \frac{(\text{Present CGPA} \times \text{Number of Semesters Completed}) + \text{This Semester's CGPA}}{\text{Number of Semesters Completed} + 1} $$

This formula is a common approximation used by students to estimate their academic standing.
